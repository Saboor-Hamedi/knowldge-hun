## 🔐 Vault Security & Firewall

KnowledgeHub features a professional-grade **Airlock Security Architecture** designed to protect your sensitive data.

### 1. The Firewall Overlay

When a master password is set, KnowledgeHub activates a high-performance firewall overlay on startup and session lock.

### 2. Cryptographic Implementation

- **Zero Cloud Footprint**: Your password is never sent to any server.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: We store only the hash, never the plain-text password.

### 3. Session Management

- **Instant Lock**: Use `Ctrl + L` to immediately secure your workspace.
- **Verification**: High-risk operations require a secondary password prompt.
