## 🧠 The KnowledgeHub Way: Best Practices

### 1. Atomic Note Taking

Keep notes focused on a single concept. This makes RAG search 10x more effective.

### 2. Link, Don't Categorize

Links are better than folders. Use WikiLinks `[[ ]]` to create organic hierarchies.

### 3. Use the Console for Discovery

Instead of browsing folders, use semantic search: `find authentication implementation`.

### 4. Interactive Graph

Clicking a node instantly shifts your context. Use the graph to discover unexpected connections.
